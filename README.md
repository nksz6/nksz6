# *HELLO!* ðŸ‘‹
<pre> welcome to my github </pre>

I'm Nick Kelley, a seinior in the Computer Science program at Metropolitan State University. 

I really enjoy programming, aside from learning new skills over the summer I completed my first internship!

Am currently developing a [Landscape Calculator](https://github.com/nksz6/Landscape-Calculator) which aims to help automate the bidding process for landscaping.
It's fully functional right now and I have a link to the live demo on the repo, but I am continuing to work on improvements. 

My next project is a Angular + .NET API, deploying to Azure. 

You can [email me](mailto:kelley.nicholas@outlook.com)
or [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelleynick/).
