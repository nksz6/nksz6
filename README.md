# *HELLO!* üëã
<pre> welcome to my github ^_^ </pre>

I'm Nick Kelley, a seinior in the Computer Science program at Metropolitan State University. 

I really enjoy programming, and aside from learning new skills over the summer I completed my first internship!

I am currently developing a [Landscape Calculator](https://github.com/nksz6/Landscape-Calculator) which aims to help automate the bidding process for landscaping.

It is fully functional right now and you should check out the [live demo!](https://nikelley.com)

My next project is a Angular + .NET API, deploying to Azure. 

You can [email me](mailto:kelley.nicholas@outlook.com)
or [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelleynick/).
