## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome!

Hello! ^_^ My name is Nick Kelley. I am a student at Metropolitan State University, in the BS Computer Science program. 

I have a huge interest in coding! I am trying to learn new skills over the summer.

I am working on projects in Java & learning Docker right now.

I will reorganize my repo's soon, some of it is irrelevant.
