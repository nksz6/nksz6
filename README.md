# *HELLO!* 👋
<pre> welcome to my github ^_^ </pre>

I'm Nick Kelley, a senior in the Computer Science program at Metropolitan State University, graduating summer 2026. 

I LOVE programming. This summer I completed my first internship and it was a ton of fun!

I recently made [Landscape Calculator](https://github.com/nksz6/Landscape-Calculator), it aims to assist with cost estimation for landscaping projects.
It is fully functional right now and you should check out the [live demo!](https://nikelley.com)

Currently working on an Angular + .NET project called KeikoKeeper, more to come on this soon.

I am actively looking for employment, please reach out to me with opportunities!

You can [email me](mailto:kelley.nicholas@outlook.com)
or [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelleynick/).
