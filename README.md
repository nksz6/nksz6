## Hello 👋, Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

Hi! My name is Nick Kelley. I am a student at Metropolitan State University.

I'm in the BS Computer Science program, I'll be starting my senior year in the fall. 

I really enjoy programming! I have been learning new skills over the summer.

I’m currently developing a [Landscape Calculator](https://github.com/nksz6/Landscape-Calculator) which aims to help estimate landscaping materials and costs.

I am learning Angular and plan to use it on my next project.

You can [email me](mailto:kelley.nicholas@outlook.com)
or [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelleynick/).
