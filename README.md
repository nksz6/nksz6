## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome!

Hello! My name is Nick Kelley. I am a student at Metropolitan State University.

I'm in the BS Computer Science program, I'll be starting my senior year in the fall. 

I really enjoy programming! I have been learning new skills over the summer.

I am currently working on https://github.com/nksz6/Landscape-Calculator.

I am learning Angular and plan to use it on my next project.

You can email me at: kelley.nicholas@outlook.com or go to my LinkedIn.
