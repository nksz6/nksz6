## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome!

Hello! My name is Nick Kelley. I am a student at Metropolitan State University.

I'm in the BS Computer Science program, I'll be starting my senior year next fall. 

I really enjoy programming! I am trying to learn new skills over the summer.

My favorite language is Java, but I am finding other languages more useful.

I am currently working on a Landscaping Calculator using the PERN Stack!

Learning the web framework Angular.
