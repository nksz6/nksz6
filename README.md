# *HELLO!* ðŸ‘‹
<pre> welcome to my github </pre>

I'm Nick Kelley, a CS student student attending Metropolitan State University. 

I really enjoy programming! I have been learning new skills over the summer.

Iâ€™m currently developing a [Landscape Calculator](https://github.com/nksz6/Landscape-Calculator) which aims to help estimate landscaping materials and costs.

I am learning Angular and plan to use it on my next project.
