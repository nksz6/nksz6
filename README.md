## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome!

Hello! My name is Nick Kelley. I am a student at Metropolitan State University.

I'm in the BS Computer Science program, I'll be starting my senior year next fall. 

I really enjoy programming! I am trying to learn new skills over the summer.

My favorite language is Java, but I am in the process of "broadening my horizons". ðŸ˜‚

I am currently working on a Landscaping Calculator using the PERN Stack!

Angular is next up on my bucket list.

Depending on the job market when I graduate, I am considering military service or pursuing a masters.
