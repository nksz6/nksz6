## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome!

Hello! My name is Nick Kelley. I am a student at Metropolitan State University.

I'm in the BS Computer Science program, I'll be starting my senior year in the fall. 

I really enjoy programming! I have been learning new skills over the summer.

My favorite language is Java, but have been using a lot more JS lately. 

I am currently working on a Landscaping Calculator using the PERN Stack.

Also learning how to use the Angular web framework.

You can email me at: kelley.nicholas@outlook.com or go to my LinkedIn.
